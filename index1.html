                            <p>Chris was born in Cleveland, Ohio. He lived and grew up in the suburb Avon. Chris graduated from Avon High School with honors where he wrestled and was very active in the Marching Band, Jazz Band, and Wind Ensemble. Chris earned his BA in Psychology from the University of Toledo and his MPH in Epidemiology from the Northwest Ohio Consortium for Public Health at the University of Toledo and Bowling Green University.</p>
                            <p>Upon graduation from his MPH, Chris returned to Cleveland where he worked as a Clinical Research Facilitator at Case Western Reserve University. Given little access to the opportunities he was searching for, Chris moved to Chicago, Illinois in the summer of 2012. In Chicago he found employment at Thresholds, a provider of community services for people with Severe Mental Illness. Chris worked in the research department, which at the time was connected with Dartmouth College. Chris was quickly promoted to Research Coordinator and coordinated many projects.</p>
                            <p>A study he was heavily involved in (coordinating, recruiting and following participants) was a study on the use of a mobile application as an additive to the treatment of Schizophrenia. Chris did much of the testing of the app while it was being developed which lead him to working closely with the development team at the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies at Northwestern University. When the research department made some major changes including cutting ties with Dartmouth, Chris reached out the CBITs to see if they had any openings as he enjoyed working closely in the development of applications. CBITs was looking for someone to head Quality Control and given their history with Chris and Chris's interest in the application development process, both parties thought this would be a good fit.</p>
                            <p>Chris started at CBITs in the spring of 2014. At the beginning he did mostly manual testing of the applications being developed. This quickly became difficult as CBITs has between 10 and 20 active projects at any given time. To speed up the process, Chris taught himself to write automated test suites using Selenium (and later Appium). Chris primarily wrote in Ruby but an understanding of JavaScript was necessary for working with Selenium and Appium. Over the next two years, Chris wrote nearly a dozen test suites and worked very closely with the development team during the development of the apps he was working. Through this work Chris realized his love for programming and application development.</p>
                            <p>Once Chris made this realization he pushed to become a developer with CBITs. Given Chris's outstanding work ethic and proven sill, CBITs promoted him to developer. While learning to program on the job is very effective, Chris also realized he needed some more structured instruction. This lead him to the NU Coding BootCamp. The NU Coding BootCamp is an intensive certificate program designed to train people to be full-stack web developers. In addition to NU Coding BootCamp, Chris also took the HarvardX course on EdX called "CS50". In "CS50" Chris learned to program in C as well as many core Computer Science subjects.</p>
